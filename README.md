# Simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction tutorial

This Julia software accompanies the paper.

- Simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction.
  Austin R. Benson, Rediet Abebe, Michael T. Schaub, Ali Jadbabaie, and Jon Kleinberg.
  In preparation.

This tutorial code is not the main software library for simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction. Instead, the tutorial has the following goals:

1. Demonstrate how to use the package ScHoLP.jl for higher-order network analysis, in particular, for simplicial closure and higher-order link prediction.
2. Reproduce results and figures that appear in the paper.

### Setup

As discussed above, this tutorial shows how to use the ScHoLP.jl library for higher-order network analysis and reproduction of results. To get the ScHoLP.jl library and start using it:

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/arbenson/ScHoLP.jl.git")
Pkg.test("ScHoLP")
using ScHoLP
```

ScHoLP.jl has thread-level parallelism available for many features (using Julia's Base.Threads).

### Data

The package comes with a few example datasets.

```julia
ex = example_dataset("example1")  # example from figure 1
typeof(ex)  # should be ScHoLP.HONData
ex.simplices, ex.nverts, ex.times, ex.name  # components of the data structure
chs = example_dataset("contact-high-school") # another dataset
```

The tutorial also comes with a few datasets.

```julia
include("common.jl")
hist_coauth = read_txt_data("coauth-MAG-History")
ndc_classes = read_txt_data("NDC-classes")
enron = read_txt_data("email-Enron")
```

The collection of datasets from the paper are available from [this dataset web site](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/).

### Simplicial closures

Here we show how to count the simplicial closures as a function of the configuration of the nodes.

```julia
using ScHoLP
enron = example_dataset("email-Enron")
closure_type_counts3(enron)  # 3-node configurations
```

The closures are written to a file where the first 3 columns identify the type of triangle (0, 1, or 2 for missing, weight 1, or weight 2+). The fourth column is the number of open instances in the first 80% of the dataset and the fifth column is the number of instances that closed in the final 20% of the dataset.

```
$ cat email-Enron-3-node-closures-100.txt 
0	0	0	265772	90
0	0	1	40734	78
0	0	2	109207	334
0	1	1	2025	19
0	1	2	10669	132
0	2	2	11082	236
1	1	1	75	0
1	1	2	449	14
1	2	2	1162	56
2	2	2	888	49
```

So there were 888 triangles with 3 strong ties in the first 80% of the data, of which 49 simplicially closed in the final 20% of the data.

We can also look at 4-node configurations.

```julia
closure_type_counts4(enron)  # 4-node configurations
```

This produces the another text file. The key of the configuration is given by the first 4 columns. If all are nonnegative integers, then it represents an open tetrahedron (all six edges are present). The 0/1/2 refer to 

- 0: an open simplicial tie, i.e., 3-node subset is a triangle but has not appeared in a simplex
- 1: a weak simplicial tie, i.e., 3-node subset has appeared in exactly 1 simplex
- 2: a strong simplicial tie, i.e., 3-node subset has appeared in at least 2 simplices

If the key contains "-1", then the configuration contains exactly 5 edges (which implies exactly 2 triangles). If the key contains "-2", the configuration contains 4 edges, and if the key contains a "-3", the configuration contains 3 edges. In the latter two cases, we assume that there is a triangle in the 4-node configuration.

```
$ cat email-Enron-4-node-closures-100.txt 
-3	-3	-3	0	194830	81
-3	-3	-3	1	206119	45

1	2	2	2	46	1
2	2	2	2	16	0
```



### Higher-order link prediction

We now turn to higher-order link prediction. We begin by including the following file and generating a labeled dataset.

```julia
include("open_triangle_prediction.jl")
enron = read_txt_data("email-Enron")  # read from data/email-Enron directory
collect_labeled_dataset(enron)
```

Notice that this generates some new files in the `prediction-output` directory.

Now we can generate a bunch of scores of the open triangles from the first 80% of the dataset.
This should add a bunch of score files to the `prediction-output` directory.

```julia
collect_local_scores(enron)  # scores based on local structural features
collect_walk_scores(enron) # scores based on random walks and paths
collect_Simplicial_PPR_combined_scores(enron) # scores based on Simplicial PPR
collect_logreg_supervised_scores(enron) # scores based on logistic regression supervised method
```

Since enron is a small dataset, we can afford to decompose the Simplicial PPR scores into the gradient, curl, and harmonic components:

```julia
collect_Simplicial_PPR_decomposed_scores(enron)
```

We can evaluate how well these methods do compared to random guessing with respect to area under the precision-recall curve.
This should reproduce the line for the email-Enron dataset in Table 2 of the paper.

```julia
evaluate(enron, ["harm_mean", "geom_mean", "arith_mean", "common", "jaccard", "adamic_adar", "proj_graph_PA", "simplex_PA", "UPKatz", "WPKatz", "UPPR", "WPPR", "SimpPPR_comb", "logreg_supervised", "SimpPPR_grad", "SimpPPR_harm", "SimpPPR_curl"])
```

We can also look at the top predictions made by the algorithms.

```julia
top_predictions(enron, "harm_mean", 8)
```

This should produce the following output

```
1 (31.684211; 1): lisa.gang@enron.com; kate.symes@enron.com; bill.williams@enron.com
2 (31.159623; 0): larry.may@enron.com; sally.beck@enron.com; thomas.martin@enron.com
3 (28.544210; 1): robert.benson@enron.com; scott.neal@enron.com; barry.tycholiz@enron.com
4 (26.471520; 0): robert.benson@enron.com; john.lavorato@enron.com; john.zufferli@enron.com
5 (25.770646; 0): larry.may@enron.com; phillip.allen@enron.com; andy.zipper@enron.com
6 (25.675810; 0): chris.stokley@enron.com; robert.badeer@enron.com; kate.symes@enron.com
7 (24.950495; 0): jane.tholt@enron.com; mike.grigsby@enron.com; barry.tycholiz@enron.com
8 (24.368601; 0): jeffrey.shankman@enron.com; richard.shapiro@enron.com; fletcher.sturm@enron.com
```

These are the top 8 predictions. The tuple next to the ordered numbers, e.g., (31.684211; 1) in the first line, gives the score function value and a 0/1 indicator of whether or not the open triangle closed in the final 20% of the dataset (1 means that it closed). Here, we see that the first and third predictions were successful.

### Summary statistics

There is some basic functionality for gathering summary statistics about the datasets.

```julia
chs = example_dataset("contact-high-school")
basic_summary_statistics(chs) # prints basic summary statistics (same as Table 1 in paper)
summary_statistics(chs) # more advanced statistics (produces contact-high-school-statistics.csv)
```

The last command writes several summary statistics to a csv file. For example, "meansimpsize" is the mean number of nodes in each simplex, "projdensity" is the edge density of the projected graph, and "nclosedtri"/"nopentri" are the number of closed and open triangles. The first line of the csv file are the variables, the first line are the statistics for the full dataset and the second line are the statistics for the dataset restricted to only 3-node simplices.

```
$ cat contact-high-school-statistics.csv 
dataset,nnodes,nsimps,nconns,meansimpsize,maxsimpsize,meanprojweight,projdensity,nclosedtri,nopentri,nbbnodes,nbbconns,meanbbsimpsize,meanbbprojweight,meanbbconfigweight,bbconfigdensity,nbbconfigclosedtri,nbbconfigopentri
contact-high-school,327,172035,352718,2,5,32.644895,1.091537e-01,2370,31850,7937,18479,2.328210,2.302681,1.223864,2.044052e-01,3034,88912
contact-high-school-3-3,317,7475,22425,3,3,8.305556,5.390728e-02,2091,5721,2126,6378,3.000000,2.362222,1.132810,1.118476e-01,2094,18139
```



### Reproducing results

This section shows how to reproduce results from the paper.

##### Table 1 (basic dataset statistics)

We saw this above in the summary statistics section. The `basic_summary_statistics()` command produces the numbers.

##### Table 2 (Higher-order link prediction performance)

These numbers came from using the higher-order link prediction methods outlined above. Some of the methods are computationally expensive and take days to complete on a large memory server with 64 threads. The functions are 

- `collect_labeled_dataset()` to generate the labeled dataset based on an 80/20 split of the data
- `collect_local_scores()` to generate scores based on local structural features
- `collect_walk_scores() ` to generate scores based on random walks and paths
- `collect_Simplicial_PPR_combined_scores()` to generate scores based on simplicial PPR
- `collect_logreg_supervised_scores()` to generate scores from the supervised learning method

##### Figure 1 (small example of higher-order network)

The example higher-order network in Figure 1 is one of the examples included with the library. Here we show how to list the simplices and compute the weighted projected graph.

```julia
ex_fig1 = example_dataset("example1")

# Print out simplices
ind = 1
for (nv, t) in zip(ex_fig1.nverts, ex_fig1.times)
    simplex = ex_fig1.simplices[ind:(ind + nv - 1)]
    ind += nv
    println("$t $simplex")
end

# Get the weighted projected graph
basic_matrices(ex_fig1)[3]
```

##### Figure 2Aâ€”B (legend and simplex size distribution)

Here is a sample code snippet for computing the simplex size distribution for the email-Enron dataset.

```julia
# Example code for computing simplex size distribution
using ScHoLP
using StatsBase: countmap
enron = example_dataset("email-Enron")
num_verts, counts = [collect(v) for v  in zip(sort(countmap(enron.nverts))...)]
tot = sum(counts)
fracs = [count / tot for count in counts];
for (nv, f) in zip(num_verts, fracs)
    println("$nv: $f")
end
```

For reproducing the figure, we have pre-computed the distributions in the files `output/simplex-size-dists/*-simplex-size-dist.mat`. The following produces the plot and saves it in simplex-size-dist.pdf.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
simplex_size_dist_plot()  # produce figures 2AB --> simplex-size-dist.pdf
```

##### Figure 2Câ€”F (basic dataset structure)

These figures rely on using the `summary_statistics()` function for all datasets. For some of the larger datasets, this can take a while. The pre-computed statistics are in the `output` directory. To reproduce the figures, use the following commands, which should show an image and save it to the file dataset-structure.pdf.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
dataset_structure_plots()  # produce figures 2CDEF
```

##### Figure 2Gâ€”H (model simulation)

These figures require running simulations. Since the simulations are random, the output may not be exactly the same. The following will re-run the simulations and write the results to simulation.mat.

```julia
include("simulations.jl")
simulate() # run the simulations to produce simulation.mat (takes several minutes)
```

The simulations uses for the paper are stored in `output/simulation/simulation.mat` for convenience. The above code should produce something similar but not exactly the same (due to randomness in the simulation). The following code snippet reproduces figures 2GH.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
simulation_plots() # reproduce figures 2GH using output/simulation/simulation.mat
```

##### Figure 3 (lifecycles)

Producing results from Figure 3A uses the `process_lifecycles()` function from the ScHoLP.jl library. Figures 3Bâ€”D use the `lifecycle()` function in `lifecycle_analysis.jl`.

```julia
include("lifecycle_analysis.jl")
hist = read_txt_data("coauth-MAG-History")  # read dataset from data/coauth-MAG-History directory
# Get data from Figure 3A
closed_transition_counts, open_transition_counts = process_lifecycles(hist)
# direct transitions to simplicial closure from each state
closed_transition_counts[end, 1:(end-1)]

ndc_classes = read_txt_data("NDC-classes")  # read data from data/NDC-classes directory
node_labels = read_node_labels("NDC-classes")
node_labels[[44, 74, 76]]  # nodes in Figure 3B
lifecycle(ndc_classes, 44, 74, 76)
```

The simplex labels in the last function call are NDC codes. For example, the first one is 67296-1236. This corresponds to Reyataz as produced by Redpharm Drug, Inc. in 2003,
as recorded [here](https://ndclist.com/ndc/67296-1236/package/67296-1236-4).

##### Figure 4 (3-node configuration closure probabilities)

This figure is constructed from the simplicial closure probabilities on 3-node configurations. We showed above how to compute these. We have pre-computed the probabilities for each dataset in `output/*-3-node-closures.txt`.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
closure_probs_heat_map(3)  # Figure 4A --> closure-probs-scatter-3.pdf
three_node_scatter_plot()  # Figures 4BCD
```

##### Figure 5 (4-node configuration closure probabilities)

Similar to Figure 4, this figure is constructed from simplicial closure probabilities on 4-node configurations. We showed above how to compute these. We have pre-computed the probabilities for each dataset in `output/*-4-node-closures.txt`.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
closure_probs_heat_map(4)  # Figure 5A --> closure-probs-4.pdf
four_node_scatter_plot()  # Figures 5BCD --> closure-prob-scatter-4.pdf
```

##### Figure 6 (generalized means)

We first show how to collect the data for generalized means. The following code snippet should produce an output file `prediction-output/email-Enron-open-tris-80-100-genmeans-perf.mat`.

```julia
include("open_triangle_prediction.jl")
enron = read_txt_data("email-Enron")  # read dataset from data/email-Enron directory
collect_labeled_dataset(enron)  # generate 80/20 split on triangles
ps, improvements = collect_generalized_means(enron)
```

We pre-computed the generalized means for all of the datasets in the files `output/*-open-tris-80-100-genmeans-perf.mat`. To reproduce Figure 6, you can then use the following code snippet.

```julia
include("paper_plots.jl")
generalized_means_plot()  # Figure 6 --> generalized-means-perf.pdf
```

##### Table S1 (temporal asynchroncity)

To measure temporal asynchroncity in the datasets, we look at the number of "active interval" overlaps in the open triangles. The active interval is the time interval corresponding to the interval of time between the first and last simplices (in time) containing the two nodes.

```julia
enron = example_dataset("email-Enron")
interval_overlaps(enron)
```

This should produce the following output:

```
dataset & # open triangles & 0 overlaps & 1 overlap & 2 overlaps & 3 overlaps
email-Enron & 3317 & 0.008 & 0.130 & 0.151 & 0.711
```

##### Table S2 (dependence of tie strength and edge density at different points in time)

The results from this table use the core ScHoLP.jl and the same function we saw above for the simplicial closure probabilities. We just provide an extra input parameter to the function `closure_type_counts3()`.

```julia
using ScHoLP
enron = example_dataset("email-Enron")
for X in [40, 60, 80]
	closure_type_counts3(enron, X)  # start with first X% of data
end
```

This creates text files email-Enron-3-node-closures-{40,60,80}.txt. For convenience, we provide all of the pre-computed closure statistics.

##### Table S3 (Simplicial closure probabilities at different points in time)

The results from this table uses the core ScHoLP.jl and the same function we saw above for the simplicial closure probabilities. We just provide an extra input parameter to the function `closure_type_counts3()`.

```julia
include("common.jl")
keys, nsamples, nclosed = read_closure_stats("coauth-DBLP", 3, 60);
for (k, N, nc) in zip(keys, nsamples, nclosed)
    closure_prob = nc / N
    println("$k: $closure_prob")
end
```

##### Table S4 (4-node configuration reference figures)

This table is just for illustration and does not present computational results.

##### Table S5 (extra results from the Hodge decomposition)

This table shows the results from using the Hodge decomposition on the simplicial personalized PageRank scores. Here is how one would reproduce the line for the NDC-classes dataset.

```julia
include("open_triangle_prediction.jl")
ndc_classes = read_txt_data("NDC-classes")  # read data from data/NDC-classes directory
collect_labeled_dataset(ndc_classes) # collect the data from the 80/20 split
collect_Simplicial_PPR_decomposed_scores(ndc_classes) # collect scores
evaluate(ndc_classes, ["SimpPPR_comb", "SimpPPR_grad", "SimpPPR_harm", "SimpPPR_curl"]) # print relative scores
```

##### Table S6 (output predictions)

We showed how to look at the top predictions in the higher-order link prediction section above.
