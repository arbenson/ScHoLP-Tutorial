This dataset is derived from the Microsoft Academic Graph available as part of
the Open Academic Graph. The raw data was downloaded from
https://www.openacademic.ai/oag/

Each simplex corresponds to a publication whose field of study includes the tag
"History". Each node in a simplex is an author on the publication. A timestamp
is the year of publication.

Additional files are available from
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/coauth-MAG-History/index.html
that map the node IDs to names and the simplices to paper titles.
